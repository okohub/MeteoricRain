—————————

This is a simple Java - Swing game which is a nice example for Swing beginners and intermediates.
 
I wrote it 2-3 years ago in University, codes are not refactored and there should be some bugs in them, but actually you can find usage of these main subjects in game :

* Playing a sound,
* Usage example for java.util.Preferences API,
* An “ImagePanel” implementation for your images,
* Using Custom True Type fonts and custom images,
* Changing Look And Feel 
* Implementing Listeners

and some other fancy things :)

You can find another things in Options menu when you open the game. Feel free to explore :)

Application uses SDK 7 but you can also compile with lower versions if you fix some combo box codes.

Known Bugs

————————————
* In a one jar, music is not playing, i did not go deep into it (actually i don’t have time to fix bugs and refactor codes now), but feel free to contribute. İf you try to run from your IDE, there should be no problem.

And, last thing, for 8bit lovers, i will tell you what music is later :)
